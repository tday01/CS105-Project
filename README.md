# CS105-Project: Stock Market Prediction

The goal of this project is to scrape website data, clean scraped data, perform exploratory data analysis 
through visualizations, and finally, use machine learning algorithms to make predictions from collected data.

The datasets consist of live and historic metrics for the top 100 stocks on the Nasdaq (intraday). The
machine learning algorithms predict the best 5 stocks to buy based on historic performance.

Note: This project is an academic exercise and not intended to be used in actual market trading.

The project was completed in 3 phases:

###### [Phase 1: Scraper and API](https://github.com/CS-UCR/cs105-prj-phase3-jellybean/tree/master/Phase%201)

###### [Phase 2: Scrape, Clean, and EDA](https://github.com/CS-UCR/cs105-prj-phase3-jellybean/tree/master/Phase%202)

###### [Phase 3: Machine Learning for Stock Prediction](https://github.com/CS-UCR/cs105-prj-phase3-jellybean/tree/master/Phase%203)
